# GPS: Global Positioning System

For emergency communications, it's vital to know the sender's location and the
precise time of the transmission.

To accomplish this, Ribbit utilizes the GPS in your computer or smartphone.

Currently, this app updates the GPS information every five seconds.
Then, when sending a message, the app will get the current position and time.
